Medieval-ish cities for Minetest

This mod makes pseudo-medieval cities. It's more of an experiment than anything, but might be fun for someone to play with. Right now it creates perfectly square blocks (occupying the entire map chunk) which contain two roads and several buildings.

City blocks will generate any place that's relatively flat and largely above water level. Natural terrain is left alone everywhere else.
